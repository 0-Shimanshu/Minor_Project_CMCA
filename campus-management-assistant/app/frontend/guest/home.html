        <p>
            Campus Management Assistant is a centralized academic platform

<!-- Explanation -->
<section class="explanation">
    <h2>Why This Platform Exists</h2>
    <p>
        Campus-related information is often scattered across notice boards,
        messaging groups, and informal communication channels. This fragmentation
        leads to confusion, misinformation, and missed updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Campus Management Assistant addresses this issue by acting as a
        <strong>single verified source of truth</strong>, where all information
        is published or reviewed by authorized campus personnel before reaching users.

    <h2>Public Access Features</h2>

    <div class="public-item">
        <h3>📢 Public Notices</h3>
        <p>
            Public notices are official campus announcements that are accessible
            to all users without requiring login. These notices typically include
            general academic updates, campus-wide events, administrative deadlines,
            and information intended for broad visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every public notice displayed on this platform is either published
            directly by campus administrators or approved by authorized moderators,
            ensuring accuracy, authenticity, and reliability.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="public-item">
        <h3>🤖 Public AI Chatbot</h3>
        <p>
            The public AI chatbot allows guests to ask general questions related
            to campus facilities, procedures, and publicly available information.
            It is designed to assist users without requiring authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chatbot responds strictly using verified campus documents stored
            within the system. If sufficient information is not available, the
            chatbot explicitly states that the answer cannot be provided, preventing
            misinformation or assumptions.
